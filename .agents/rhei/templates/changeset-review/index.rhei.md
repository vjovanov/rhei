# Rhei: Changeset Review — {{change_ref}}
**States:** changeset-review

## Overview
Two-agent changeset review with validation, fix proposals, smart adjudication,
and smart final fixes.

The change under review (`{{change_ref}}`) can be any of:

- a PR URL or PR number
- a branch name
- a commit SHA or range `base..head`
- a path to a `.diff` / `.patch` file

The coordinator resolves the reference to a concrete set of changed files
before splitting.

The instantiated workspace is a review scratchpad. Agents must resolve the
repository root via Git and inspect or edit repository files from that root,
not from this workspace directory.

Flow:

1. The coordinator task resolves `{{change_ref}}`, writes an architectural
   overview, splits the change into logical parts, appends one `review-<slug>`
   task per part, and appends one `aggregate` task whose `**Prior:**` waits on
   every part review.
2. Each part is reviewed independently by every configured review target:
{%- for t in review_targets %}
   - `{{ t }}`
{%- endfor %}
{%- if review_focus %}

   Each reviewer must organize findings into these focus subsections:
{%- for f in review_focus %}
   - `{{ f }}`
{%- endfor %}
{%- else %}

   Reviews are general: correctness, regressions, and material risks.
{%- endif %}
3. The smart target (`{{smart_target}}`) deduplicates review findings into
   candidate issues.
4. Candidate issues are validated independently by:
{%- for t in validation_targets %}
   - `{{ t }}`
{%- endfor %}
5. Fix proposals are produced independently by:
{%- for t in proposal_targets %}
   - `{{ t }}`
{%- endfor %}
6. The smart target (`{{smart_target}}`) aggregates those proposals into a
   proposal matrix.
7. The smart target (`{{smart_target}}`) decides discrepancies and writes the
   final fix plan.
8. The smart target applies the accepted fixes{% if fix_prepare != "none" %} in a `{{fix_prepare}}` workspace{% endif %}{% if fix_commit != "none" %} and performs the `{{fix_commit}}` commit step{% endif %}.

## Notes

- The workspace is "living": the coordinator appends review and aggregate
  task files under `tasks/` during the run. `rhei reset` clears state but does
  not delete dynamically appended task files.
- Instantiate the workspace inside the repository under review, ideally under
  `.agents/scratchpad/`, so `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from the workspace
  resolves the project root deterministically.
- The bundled settings add `codex[xhigh]`, which passes
  `model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"` to Codex. The default smart target is
  `codex[xhigh]:openai:gpt-5.5`. Claude Code is included as a second default
  reviewer, but Rhei does not currently expose a Claude reasoning-effort flag.
