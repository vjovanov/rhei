# Rhei: Panta Spec Deliberation
**States:** multi-agent-deliberation

## Overview

This workspace resolves one discussion through a structured multi-agent
deliberation:

1. split the input into separate decision points
2. collect independent proposals from configured target agents for each point
3. aggregate agreements and disagreements
4. run one multi-agent discussion pass for each point
5. resolve every point, synthesize the final solution, and present it to a human
