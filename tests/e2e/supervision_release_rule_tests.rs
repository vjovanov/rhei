// Rule 3 of the empty-visit test, clause by clause: what "the subtree can still
// move" means for a descendant that is waiting on a poll's clock or on work
// outside its supervisor's subtree, and why neither excuses a `inputs:` file
// that only the supervisor writes.
//
// Its own part because these are the *scope* of the rule rather than the rule:
// each case is a pair — one where the descendant really can move and the visit
// releases, one where it cannot and the visit is held — and the pairs are what
// keep the clause from being read as an unconditional yes.
