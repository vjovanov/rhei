//! Guard: no built-in template may print a `rhei transition` invocation that
//! the CLI would reject. `--from` is the compare-and-swap guard the command is
//! built on and is a required argument, so a template that shows an invocation
//! without it hands the reader a command that always exits 2 (#117).
//!
//! §FS-rhei-transition-cmd.2: the options table marks `--from <STATE>` as
//! required, and §FS-rhei-transition-cmd says why — only the caller whose
//! expected `--from` matches the task's actual state wins the race.
