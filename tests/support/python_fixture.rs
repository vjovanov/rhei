// nothing Unix about it. Python is installed on every GitHub runner and this
// repository already depends on it (`scripts/*.py`, the pre-commit hook), so a
// fixture written in Python needs no shell, no `chmod`, and no `.exe`.

// this file in with `include!`, where an inner doc comment cannot open a file.
