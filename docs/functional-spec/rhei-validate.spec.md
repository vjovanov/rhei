# FS-rhei-validate: `rhei validate`

Validate a Rhei plan or Directory Workspace against the Rhei plan language,
the resolved state machine, project settings, and runtime context checks. The
command is read-only and exists to make execution predictable before a worker
or orchestrator mutates plan state. §GOAL-rhei-outcomes

## 1. Usage

```bash
rhei validate [RHEI_PLAN_OR_WORKSPACE]
rhei validate --watch [RHEI_PLAN_OR_WORKSPACE]
rhei --state-machine <PATH> validate [RHEI_PLAN_OR_WORKSPACE]
```

`<RHEI_PLAN_OR_WORKSPACE>` may be a single `.rhei.md` file, a Directory
Workspace root, or a Panta project directory; omitted, the target is resolved
by walking up from the current directory (§FS-rhei-panta.6). When a workspace
root is passed, validation loads `index.rhei.md` and the workspace task files.
A project target validates the whole merged graph.

### 1.1. Why there is no `--rhei`

Unlike `rhei list`, `rhei run`, and `rhei reset`, `rhei validate` takes no
`--rhei` narrowing flag. Narrowing those commands selects *tickets to act on*,
which is well defined. Narrowing validation would have to select *diagnostics
to report*, and a project's diagnostics are not partitioned by rhei: the state
machine, merged settings, link bases, and cross-rhei `**Prior:**` resolution
are all project-wide, and a load failure in one rhei is what stops the others
from resolving. A flag that filtered the reported subset would hide real
errors behind an apparently narrower green — the opposite of what validation
is for. Validate the project; the diagnostics name their own rhei.

## 2. Options

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--watch` | No | false | Re-run validation when the plan or resolved states file changes |
| `--state-machine <PATH>` | No | built-in/default discovery | Global option selecting an explicit states YAML file |

## 3. State Machine Resolution

Validation uses the state-machine resolution order defined in the
[Plan Language Specification](rhei-plan-language.spec.md#13-state-machine-resolution):
explicit `--state-machine <PATH>` first, rhei-local `**States:**` declarations,
Panta default inheritance for rheis that omit `**States:**`, omitted effective
declarations as the built-in `rhei` machine, declared `**States:** rhei` with
built-in fallback, and declared custom names only when a matching
auto-discovered file is available.

If a plan declares a non-default state machine name and no matching
auto-discovered file is available, validation fails and directs the caller to
pass `--state-machine`.

## 4. Behavior

1. Load and parse the plan. Single-file validation and Directory Workspace task
   file validation collect every recoverable parse error before returning so
   users can fix related issues in one pass. Workspace index parse errors remain
   fail-fast because later task-file diagnostics may depend on index structure.
2. Resolve the state machine and validate plan semantics, including state
   values, task ids, dependencies, node policy, terminal and gating states,
   counted-loop syntax, and artifact contracts. §FS-rhei-plan-language §FS-rhei-states
3. Load merged global and project settings, then validate referenced agents,
   models, MCP servers, skills, and snapshot settings used by the state
   machine. §FS-rhei-agents §FS-rhei-snapshots
4. Validate snapshot plan context and report orphaned snapshot diagnostics as
   warnings when a snapshot cache exists. §FS-rhei-snapshot-operations
5. Report every ticket that reached a successful terminal state while one of
   its `**Prior:**` dependencies is still unsatisfied as a **warning** naming
   the ticket and each blocking prior with its state. Such a plan contradicts
   the dependency semantics it declares, and no other surface reveals it: a
   terminal ticket drops out of `rhei list --blocked` and out of readiness
   entirely, so the plan reads as healthy. The condition is reachable through
   the deliberate `rhei transition` escape hatch
   (§FS-rhei-transition-cmd.3), by editing a `**Prior:**` onto an
   already-completed ticket, and by a prior that was later cancelled — all
   legitimate authoring moves. It is therefore a warning, never an error:
   validation must surface the inconsistency without making an existing plan
   unloadable.
6. Exit non-zero when any validation error remains. Warnings do not make the
   command fail.

`rhei validate` does not acquire task locks, run callbacks, spawn agents,
spawn programs, create runtime files, or rewrite the plan.

### 4.1. Unresolved `**Prior:**` references

A `**Prior:**` that resolves to no ticket is reported under **the id the author
wrote**. A dotted reference whose leading segment names no rhei is kept
unqualified at load precisely so this error can quote the source
(§AR-rhei-panta.3); reporting it under a citing-rhei prefix would name an id
that appears in no file and cannot be searched for.

Such a reference is ambiguous — a mistyped rhei name or a mistyped rhei-local
hierarchical id — so the message rules out both readings: it names the missing
rhei with the project's rhei ids, and states that the citing rhei has no ticket
under that id either.

A correction is offered only when it is actionable. The leading segment is
matched against the project's rhei ids within a small edit distance, and the
resulting id is suggested only when it **resolves to an existing ticket other
than the citing task**. A suggestion that does not resolve trades one dead end
for another, and one that names the citing task proposes a self-dependency.
Names shorter than three characters yield no suggestion at all: below that
length every id is within one edit of every other, so a near miss carries no
signal.

A prior under a *known* rhei is an ordinary missing ticket and is reported
without further explanation.

### 4.2. Diagnostic parity across scopes

A parse error must read the same whether the plan was reached directly
(`rhei validate plans/auth.rhei.md`) or through its project (`rhei validate`
inside a Panta project). Both forms report **every** recoverable problem in the
offending file, not just the first, and both render the file path relative to
the invocation directory when that is shorter than the absolute path.

Parity matters most for the errors that cascade. A task heading authored under a
content section rather than `## Tasks` fails first as *"Metadata field appears
outside a task"* on a line the author did not get wrong; only the structural
*"Tasks section must be the final `##` chapter"* diagnostic — which recovery
reaches last — explains the mistake. Reporting one error per file would hide it
behind the symptom, in the invocation form `rhei init` steers new authors toward
(§FS-rhei-init).

The project loader still stops at the first failing rhei entry: a project whose
second rhei also fails reports the first one, and the next run reports the next.
Completeness is promised *within* a file, not across a project.

## 5. Watch Mode

With `--watch`, the command resolves the same state machine once, prints a
watch-start message, runs an initial validation pass, and then re-runs
validation when the plan file or resolved states file changes.

Watch mode reports each pass independently. A failed pass does not terminate
the watcher; file watcher initialization errors do.

## 6. Output

On success:

```text
Validation succeeded
```

Warnings are printed after the success line:

```text
Validation succeeded
warning: <diagnostic>
```

On failure, diagnostics are emitted through the normal CLI error renderer and
the process exits non-zero.
