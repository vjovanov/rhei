# FS-rhei-init: `rhei init`

Set up a Panta project. By default `rhei init` creates a **`panta/`** folder
inside the host directory and makes *that* the project: the plans and their
generated output live in one place, out of the host repository's way, and the
folder is gitignored — planning state is treated as working material of the
repository, not part of its content. `--here` instead makes the host
directory itself the project (the adoption mode for a directory that already
holds plans meant to be versioned).

Init writes the one file a project requires — the `index.panta.md` manifest —
plus the low-cost conveniences that keep a project healthy from day one:
ignore rules, and an agent-discovery note so coding agents working in the
repository find the Rhei workflow on their own. Everything else about a
project (rheis, tickets, state machines) is added with `rhei new`
([§FS-rhei-new](rhei-new.spec.md#fs-rhei-new-rhei-new)) or by creating files by hand, per [§FS-rhei-panta.2](rhei-panta.spec.md#2-default-home-for-new-rheis).

Initialization is a convenience, not a gate: a project is defined by its
files, and a hand-written `index.panta.md` is exactly as valid as a generated
one ([§AR-rhei-panta.1](../architecture/rhei-panta.spec.md#1-on-disk-layout)). This deliberately contrasts with database-backed
trackers, where `init` must provision storage before anything works.

## 1. Usage

```bash
rhei init [DIR] [--here] [--title <title>] [--no-agents] [--force]
```

`DIR` is the **host** directory (default: the current directory; created when
missing). The project directory is `DIR/panta/`, or `DIR` itself with
`--here`.

### 1.1. Options

| Flag                | Default            | Description                                             |
|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `--here`            | off                | Make `DIR` itself the project instead of `DIR/panta/`. The mode for adopting a directory of existing, versioned plans |
| `--title <title>`   | from the host      | Project title written to the manifest heading           |
| `--no-agents`       | off                | Skip the `AGENTS.md` agent-discovery note (§4)          |
| `--force`           | off                | Re-initialize an existing project: overwrite the manifest (re-deriving the title); companion files update in place. Pair with `--here` when the host itself is the project (§2) |

The default title is derived from the **host** directory's name in both
modes — `panta/` is a location, not an identity: `-` and `_` become spaces
and each word is capitalized (`my-project` → `My Project`).

## 2. Behavior

1. **Refuse an existing project** unless `--force`. When the project
   directory already contains `index.panta.md` — and, in default mode, also
   when the host itself is already a project — the command fails stating the
   directory is already a project, names the re-init path, and changes
   nothing. With `--force` the manifest is rewritten from scratch — a
   hand-edited manifest is deliberately clobbered, which is why force is
   opt-in — and the companion files update in place: the `.gitignore`
   entries and the marked `AGENTS.md` block are idempotent, so a forced
   re-init never duplicates them. A host that is itself a project refuses
   default mode even under `--force` — the refusal names `--force --here` —
   because force means re-initialize, never "nest a fresh `panta/` project
   inside this one": the child would lose every target resolution to the
   host manifest ([§FS-rhei-panta.6](rhei-panta.spec.md#6-project-scope-and-command-behavior)) and could never be reached by a bare
   command.
2. **Refuse to shadow existing plans** in default mode. When the host holds
   bare `*.rhei.md` files or workspace rheis, a `panta/` project would not
   discover them; the error offers both fixes — `--here` to adopt them in
   place, or moving them into `panta/` first. `--here` and `--force` skip
   this check. The mirror-image check guards `--here`: when the host is not
   itself a project but already holds a default-mode project at `panta/`,
   adopting the host would shadow that project — target resolution prefers
   the host manifest ([§FS-rhei-panta.6](rhei-panta.spec.md#6-project-scope-and-command-behavior)), so every ticket in `panta/` would
   become unreachable by inference. The command refuses, names the child
   project, and offers the fixes (keep using `panta/`, or move its contents
   into the host and remove it first); `--force` does not skip this refusal,
   for the same reason it cannot nest a fresh `panta/` inside a host project
   (point 1).
3. **Warn about an enclosing project.** When an ancestor directory contains
   `index.panta.md`, init proceeds but warns on stderr: nested projects are
   almost always a mistake, and the outer project will not discover the inner
   one ([§AR-rhei-panta.1](../architecture/rhei-panta.spec.md#1-on-disk-layout) discovery does not recurse into rhei roots).
4. **Write the manifest**: `# Panta: <title>`, and nothing else. The state
   machine is per-rhei, defaulted by the project ([§FS-rhei-panta.6](rhei-panta.spec.md#6-project-scope-and-command-behavior)): a
   discovered rhei that declares its own machine runs under it, and one that
   declares nothing was authored against the built-in default and keeps it.
   There is nothing for init to adopt — writing a discovered machine into the
   manifest would silently re-govern every *future* rhei that declares
   nothing. (An earlier revision adopted a unanimously-declared machine as
   the project default, back when a divergent member was a load error; the
   per-rhei model removed both the error and the need.)
5. **Seed ignore rules** (§3).
6. **Write the agent-discovery note** unless `--no-agents` (§4).
7. **Report what became visible** (§5).

## 3. Ignore rules

In default mode the whole project folder is ignored at the host —

```gitignore
panta/
```

— because a `panta/` project is working state by design. The project folder
additionally gets its own `.gitignore` covering generated output, so a user
who later decides to version their plans (by deleting the host's `panta/`
entry) does not start committing runtime state:

```gitignore
runtime/
.rhei/cache/
```

With `--here` only the generated-output entries are seeded, into the host's
`.gitignore` — adopted plans are assumed to be content worth versioning.

In both modes entries are appended one at a time and only when missing, so a
hand-maintained ignore file is never rewritten or reordered.

## 4. Agent-discovery note (`AGENTS.md`)

Rhei projects are driven by coding agents, and an agent dropped into a
directory has no way to know it plans work with Rhei. Init creates
`AGENTS.md` in the **host directory** — the directory `rhei init` was given —
or appends to an existing one, with a short note between stable markers naming
where the project lives. Every path init writes is one it chose inside the
host directory; where the user has symlinked a host instruction file to an
ancestor, the bytes land wherever they pointed it, because following a pointer
somebody set deliberately is honoring it, not escaping the host.

One exception: when the host has no `AGENTS.md` but does have a `CLAUDE.md`,
the note is appended to `CLAUDE.md` instead. A project whose agent
instructions live only in `CLAUDE.md` has an agent that never opens
`AGENTS.md`, so creating one there files the note where nobody reads — the
note goes into the instruction file that is actually used. A host with both
files (including the common `CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md` symlink) keeps `AGENTS.md`
as the target, and re-running init finds and rewrites the note in whichever
file carries it. Init names the file it changed either way, in the host-changes
list (§5).

The note:

```markdown
<!-- rhei:begin -->
## Rhei

The Rhei (Panta) project for this repository lives in `panta/`. Plans are
`*.rhei.md` files and workspace directories; ticket ids are
project-qualified (`<rhei>.<id>`). Add work with
`rhei new "<title>" --under <rhei>`, and capture a ticket that has no
rhei yet with `--under basin`. Work tickets with `rhei list`,
`rhei next`, and `rhei complete`; validate edits with `rhei validate`.
Orchestration (`rhei run`) is started by humans, never by agents.
<!-- rhei:end -->
```

The note is anchored at the host because the host is the only directory the
user named. An earlier revision anchored it at the enclosing **repository
root** — the nearest ancestor containing `.git` — so that a directory of plans
adopted with `rhei init <subdir> --here` was advertised where coding agents
read. That walk cannot tell a plans subdirectory of the repository the agent
works in from a host that merely happens to sit inside an unrelated
repository, and in the second case init appended the note to a tracked,
hand-written instruction file the user never named. An enclosing repository's
`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` is therefore never modified; init reads one only to
word the hint below.

Discoverability from an enclosing root is the user's call, and init only
prompts it: it prints one hint line naming that root's instruction file, so a
user who wants agents starting there to find the project can add a pointer
themselves. The hint is a suggestion, never a write. Three conditions have to
hold together for it to print — the note is being written (`--no-agents` says
nothing at all), the host lies strictly inside a git repository (a host that
*is* the root has nothing above it to point from), and that root's instruction
file does not already read as carrying a Rhei note — a marker-delimited
region, or a `## Rhei` section whose body still carries the note's own
sentence. That last one is a test on the text, not a claim about who wrote it.
The case it is for is the upgrade: a note an earlier revision wrote to the
enclosing root is still sitting there, and asking again for a pointer that is
already on the page is noise. But init cannot tell that note from one a user
wrote by hand, or from one pointing at a different project, and it does not
try — judging whose note it is means ruling a user's own words about Rhei out
of a file init has just promised not to write. A root that already reads as
spoken for gets no hint, whoever spoke for it. Init leaves what it found where
it is — removing it is the user's call, in their own file. Deciding which of
the root's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` to name, and whether one of them reads
as carrying a note, is the whole of what init reads above the host for.
Otherwise the hint follows the layout, not the write: a re-run that changes
nothing still prints it, because it describes where the project sits rather
than a file init touched.

The first sentence of the note names where the project is relative to the
host: `panta/` in default mode, and "This directory is a Rhei (Panta)
project." with `--here`, where the host is the project itself. The note deliberately names only the worker surface —
`list`, `next`, `complete`, `validate` — and marks `rhei run` as
human-initiated: orchestration spawns agent fleets and spends money, so an
agent must never be instructed to start it. Rewriting the note first strips every trace of a previous
one — marker-delimited regions, orphaned markers, and a marker-less `## Rhei`
section still carrying the note body — so init is idempotent even after a
third-party merge mangled the markers, and removal is one block deletion.
Stripping only ever removes the note's own material: an orphaned begin
marker (its end marker lost) is removed alone, never together with the user
content that follows it.
Richer per-agent integration (skills for Claude Code, Cursor, …) stays with
`rhei install-skills` ([§FS-rhei-install-skills](rhei-install-skills.spec.md#fs-rhei-install-skills-rhei-install-skills)); init's final output points
at it rather than duplicating it.

## 5. Discovery report

After writing, init loads the project through the ordinary discovery pass
([§AR-rhei-panta.1](../architecture/rhei-panta.spec.md#1-on-disk-layout)) and reports where it lives and what it contains:

```text
Initialized Panta project "My Project" at panta/ with no rheis yet. Add one
by dropping a `<id>.rhei.md` file or a workspace directory next to
index.panta.md.
```

An adoption (`--here`) over existing plans reports the discovered rheis
(`with 2 rheis: auth, billing`). When discovery fails — for example a plan
file whose stem is not a valid rhei id — init still succeeds (the manifest is
written) and surfaces the load error as a warning, so init doubles as a first
validation.

Init also **names every file it wrote or changed outside the project
directory**, and states the gitignore consequence in default mode:

```text
Also changed in the host directory: .gitignore, AGENTS.md
Note: `panta/` is gitignored — planning state is working material, not
repository content. Delete that entry to version the project.
```

Init runs inside someone else's repository and edits two files there that the
user did not name. Writing them silently is the surprise: a team discovers
weeks later that no plan was ever committed, and the `.gitignore` line that
caused it was never mentioned. Only files actually changed are listed —
re-running init over an up-to-date `.gitignore` and `AGENTS.md` reports
neither, because the entries and the marked block are idempotent (§2).

The omitted-plan-target resolution knows the convention: a `panta/` child
containing `index.panta.md` resolves as the project for commands run in the
host directory or anywhere under it ([§FS-rhei-panta.6](rhei-panta.spec.md#6-project-scope-and-command-behavior)), so after init, bare
`rhei list` works from the whole repository.

## 6. What init does not do

- It does not create rheis or tickets. `rhei new` is the verb for that
  ([§FS-rhei-new](rhei-new.spec.md#fs-rhei-new-rhei-new)) and composes: `rhei init && rhei new "Auth"`.
- It does not move existing plan files into `panta/` — adopting in place is
  `--here`; moving content is left to the user (and note that moving a
  *tracked* plan into the gitignored `panta/` untracks it).
- It does not scaffold from templates — that is `rhei instantiate`
  ([§FS-rhei-templates](rhei-templates.spec.md#fs-rhei-templates-rhei-templates-specification)).
- It does not touch git beyond `.gitignore`: no hooks, no commits.
- It does not write a state machine or a `**States:**` line — the manifest
  stays bare (§2); each rhei keeps the machine it declares, and the built-in
  `rhei` machine covers the rest ([§FS-rhei-states](rhei-states.spec.md#fs-rhei-states-rhei-states-specification)).
