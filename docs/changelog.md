# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **The re-spawn note on a poll state names its own `poll.max_attempts`
  instead of an internal sentinel.** A poll state is exempt from the visit
  attempt budget — `poll.max_attempts` already bounds it — and that exemption
  was encoded internally as `u64::MAX`, which `rhei run` then printed verbatim:
  `attempt 4 of 18446744073709551615`. The exemption was correct; only the
  rendering was wrong. The note now reads `attempt 4 of 96 (poll.max_attempts)`
  for a poll state, and is unchanged for every other state. (PR #N)
- **The root `CHANGELOG.md` no longer claims the release maintains it.** It
  opened by saying this file's `Unreleased` section is what "release automation
  promotes into a numbered section here at release time", citing
  §FS-rhei-distribution.5 — which describes a promotion *within*
  `docs/changelog.md`, archiving the displaced release under `docs/changelog/`,
  and says nothing about the root file. `prepare_changelog_release.py` never
  opens it. Documenting a behaviour that never ran, it drifted the whole way: no
  `0.2.0`, `0.3.0` or `0.3.1` section, and an `Unreleased` note still announcing
  project-qualified ticket ids as a forthcoming breaking change eight days after
  they shipped in 0.2.0 — a note that nearly sent 0.3.1 out as a minor bump. The
  header now says where the changelog is and that this file is not maintained by
  the release, and the stale note is gone. The `0.1.0` section stays:
  `docs/changelog/0.1.0.md` is a four-line summary, so this is the only record of
  the initial release's feature list and its crates.io naming limitation.
  (PR #115)

## 2. [0.3.1] - 2026-08-30

- **The release commit stages `xtask/Cargo.toml`.** `Auto bump` had failed on
  its last three runs, always at `release.yml`'s version check and always before
  the publish step, with `xtask/Cargo.toml internal dependency requirement is
  stale: ... version = "=0.3.0"`. `set-release-version.py` bumps that pin
  correctly — it goes out of its way to, and its docstring says why: "`xtask`
  lives outside `crates/`, so a plain glob there silently leaves its pins at the
  old version and the bump stops resolving." The release commit then staged
  exactly that plain glob, so the bump lived in the runner's working tree, never
  reached the candidate branch, and the verifier rejected it. The manifest is now
  staged beside the others, with the reason recorded so the list is not trimmed
  back later. (PR #113)

- **The `rhei-plan-writer` skill says where a plan file belongs.** It specified
  the plan format, states, ids, and validation and never named a location, so an
  agent following it saved a plan at a host repository's root and `rhei init`
  refused to adopt the directory until the file moved. The refusal is the good
  case: inside a project that already exists, discovery reads the project
  directory's immediate children and nothing else, so a plan at the repository
  root or under `panta/plans/` is not a rhei — `rhei list` never shows its
  tickets and `rhei validate` prints "Validation succeeded" over it. `## File
  Extension` becomes `## File Location and Name`, because naming a plan and
  placing it are one decision taken at one moment; it gives the default for both
  plan shapes, says to look for `index.panta.md` or run `rhei list` first,
  prefers `rhei new` over hand-writing a path, and names what the silence looks
  like when the guess is wrong. Creating the project stays the human's call, as
  the skill already said of `rhei init` under `rhei new` — the guidance is to ask
  for it and write to `panta/<id>.rhei.md` meanwhile, which a later init adopts —
  and the gitignored `panta/` now comes with its answer, `rhei init --here`,
  rather than only the question. The naming rule gained the two constraints that
  fail loudly and were unwritten: a Directory Workspace takes its id from the
  directory name, and an id must start with a letter and hold only letters,
  digits, `_` or `-`, with `basin` reserved. `## Planning Workflow` gained a save
  step, because an agent working the numbered list went from setting initial
  states to running the validation checklist without ever being told where the
  file goes. (PR #109)

- **`rhei run` asks the whole completion condition before a pass skips an agent
  invocation.** The condition has three parts — exit `0`, the declared
  `outputs:` on disk, and, when the edge the exit selects lands on a `final:
  true` state, the ticket's non-empty terminal result — and it lived in two
  places with two different rules. The post-exit check asked all three; the
  scheduling filter asked only whether the declared outputs existed. So a ticket
  that correctly failed the condition on one pass, with its outputs written and
  its result never written, was read on the next as having nothing left to do:
  it fell through to callback-only advancement, took the terminal edge the
  condition had just refused, and had "No agent or program ran in that state, so
  no worker result was recorded" written into its permanent result — of a state
  where an agent had run for twelve minutes and published its export.
  §FS-rhei-run.3 step 5 already said that no transition fires and the ticket
  stays where it is, and that the engine never speaks for a worker that ran; the
  rule is now asked in one place and a state that has not met it is run again
  rather than reclassified as finished. The same weak filter on the parallel
  refill path goes with it. Two things follow from running the state again.
  First, the engine no longer *infers* that a worker ran, and that this is a
  retry, from a log file's name and existence — an inference that credited a
  header-only log from a spawn that never started, claimed a hyphenated sibling
  state's log as its own, and narrated a re-entry as a retry because an uncounted
  state's visit number is pinned at `1`. A record written when a subprocess ends,
  keyed by the ticket's move count, answers both questions instead
  (§FS-rhei-agents.8.4), and each attempt keeps its own transcript rather than
  truncating the one that explains the previous miss. Second, a retry that
  repeats the previous prompt byte-for-byte is only spend, so a re-spawned
  invocation is told it is retrying and which artifact the previous attempt left
  unwritten, and a new **`attempts:` budget** bounds a visit — the state's own
  field, then `defaults.attempts`, then `2` — after which the ticket halts where
  it is and the run names what it owes (§FS-rhei-agents.3.2.3). `visits:` bounds
  how many times a ticket may *enter* a state; `attempts:` bounds how many times
  one entry may be *spawned*. The budget rides the same record, so it holds
  across separate `rhei run` invocations, and a genuine re-entry starts a fresh
  one; poll states keep their own `poll.max_attempts`, and an interrupted spawn
  takes an attempt log without spending budget. Without the budget the fix would
  trade a false result for unbounded re-spawning, which is why the two land
  together. §FS-rhei-agents.3.2 §FS-rhei-states.3.3 (PR #106)

- **`rhei list --ready` is the ready set, not a second opinion about it.** It
  re-derived readiness inline from four of the six conditions the scan applies —
  terminal state, gating state, `**Prior:**` satisfaction and the supervision
  barrier — and never looked at the two that touch the world: the current
  state's required `inputs:` being on disk, and a `poll:` state whose next
  attempt is still ahead. So a ticket whose brief had not been written was
  printed as ready while `rhei next` answered "no tickets are ready to claim"
  and `rhei run` halted it by name, on the surface an operator checks first.
  §FS-rhei-list.3.1 already promised the listing "lists exactly the set `rhei
  next` draws from"; it is now asked of `find_ready_tasks` itself and narrowed
  afterwards by the ordinary row filters, so there is one definition of
  readiness for the three surfaces to agree on rather than two that drift.
  Drawn from, not equal to: `rhei next` still narrows the ready set by assignee
  and initial state before it claims, so a listed ticket can be one it refuses.
  `optional: true` inputs are not part of the condition, exactly as they are not
  for the scheduler. `--blocked` becomes the exact complement — every
  non-terminal ticket is either ready or blocked, never both and never neither —
  which widens it to name the ticket waiting on a missing input, a human gate, a
  poll deadline, or a supervisor, instead of answering only the prior question.
  A third behavior moves with them: a ticket whose state no machine declares —
  a typo, or a machine edited after the plan — used to be listed as ready and is
  now reported as blocked. `rhei list` loads leniently and never validates, so
  it is the one surface that can reach such a ticket at all; nothing can be said
  about readiness in a state that does not exist, and the commands that schedule
  refuse the plan outright. This is the first filesystem read `list` does, so it
  happens only when `--ready` or `--blocked` asks for it.
  §FS-rhei-next.3 §FS-rhei-run.3 (PR #104)

- `rhei run` looks for a **member rhei's required `inputs:` under the rhei that
  owns the ticket**, not under the enclosing Panta project. The ready-set scan
  already picked an artifact root per ticket, but the two wrappers `rhei run`
  reaches it through passed no per-ticket roots, so every input resolved against
  the project root while `RHEI_ROOT`, the supervisor prompt's own
  `## Supervising This Subtree` paths, and `rhei next --peek` all used the
  member's own. A supervised member therefore halted after its supervisor's
  first visit: the brief was written exactly where the prompt said to write it,
  and the run went looking one directory up. A ticket held back by a missing
  required input now says so — on the halt message, the end-of-run summary, and
  every section of the durable report, which are one classification made under
  the roots that run scanned with — and names the absolute path it looked for,
  instead of "not scheduled before the run halted — rerun to pick it up", which
  sent the reader back to a run that halts identically.
  §AR-rhei-panta.5 §FS-rhei-run-report.3.1 (PR #101)

- **`rhei reset` no longer erases a pre-authored chain.** It returned every
  task to the state machine's one `initial: true` state, so the shape
  §FS-rhei-supervision.7 documents and the `supervised-delivery` template ships
  — a supervisor in `supervising` with children authored in `implement`,
  `review`, `fix`, … — came back with every child reading `**State:**
  supervising`. `rhei validate` passed, because every task was in a legal
  state, and the next `rhei run` dispatched the children *as supervisors*: on
  the supervisor's target, with the supervisor's instructions, and without the
  brief their own state gates on — the release gate of §FS-rhei-supervision.5.2
  was simply gone. No `profiles` block could have expressed the chain either,
  since `node_policy` resolves a profile from a node's kind and level
  (§FS-rhei-states.9.2) and those children share both. Reset now returns each
  task to the state it was **authored** in, recovered per-task from the first
  `from` recorded for it in `runtime/state-transitions.log`: a task with no
  recorded move never left its authored state and is not touched at all. With
  no ledger at a task's execution root — judged per root, so one rhei's history
  never speaks for another's — nothing records where that task came from, so
  reset changes no state and names the tasks it left outside their initial
  state rather than moving them somewhere they may never have been. It names
  only tasks a run plausibly touched, because a pre-authored chain's children
  are outside `initial` by construction and listing all of them would bury the
  one that is genuinely stale. A recorded state the machine no longer declares
  is reported and not written back, so a reset can never leave a plan that
  fails `rhei validate`. A counted-visit suffix is cleared whether or not the
  state name changes: it is runtime state, and leaving it behind while
  `stateVisits` was wiped left a reset workspace already out of visits. The
  summary and the
  `--dry-run` preview now name every task they move and where from, instead of
  printing a count that read the same whether the reset was correct or
  destructive. §FS-rhei-reset.2.2 §FS-rhei-reset.4 (PR #102)

- A new grund kind, **`REQ`** (`docs/requirements/`), for cross-cutting
  requirements every feature is held to from the moment it is specified —
  distinct from the user-visible behaviour of one feature (`FS-`) and from an
  outcome the project pursues (`GOAL-`). Requirements cite goals; specs and
  architecture cite the requirement at the point they realize it. The
  cross-platform rule is the first: §REQ-cross-platform. (PR #98)

- Rhei is a **cross-platform tool by requirement**, not by accident: Linux,
  macOS, and Windows are supported as one tool, every behaviour works and is
  tested on all three, a platform difference is declared in the spec at the
  point it occurs or it is a defect, and test fixtures are written in a form
  every platform runs. This was true of the binaries and, since Windows CI
  started running the suite, increasingly of the tests; it is now written
  down as a goal and a requirement that new work is held to from the start.
  §GOAL-rhei-outcomes §REQ-cross-platform (PR #96)

- Windows now runs the whole test suite — `cargo test --workspace
  --all-targets --locked --no-fail-fast`, the same command as Linux and macOS —
  because the fixtures no longer need a shell. The mock agents, programs,
  callbacks, validators, and redactors the suite stands up were `#!/bin/sh` and
  `#!/usr/bin/env bash` scripts, and that alone kept the CLI's end-to-end target
  off Windows; they are Python now, spawned directly with no shell, no `chmod`,
  and no shebang. The three carved-out Windows test steps are gone with them,
  and the tests that stay `#[cfg(unix)]` say at the gate which POSIX semantics
  they exercise. The committed examples and the bundled UI fixture are Python
  too — including `snapshot-continuation`'s mock agent and `ci-heal`'s two
  `git`/`gh` helpers — so a Windows user can run them wherever `python3` is on
  `PATH`. A committed settings file cannot probe for an interpreter the way the
  test harness does, so it names `python3`, and each example's README says so.
  §REQ-cross-platform.3 §REQ-cross-platform.4 §AR-ci-release.1 (PR #97)

  Running the suite there found eight things that were broken on Windows and
  are now fixed. **The system shell**: a string-form `program:` and a `cli:`
  callback both spawned `sh -c` unconditionally, though the spec has always said
  a string command runs under `/bin/sh -c` on Unix and `cmd /c` on Windows —
  where there is no `sh`, so both died looking for one before running a line of
  their own. §FS-rhei-programs.1.1 **A create refused its own read**:
  `rhei new` locks the plan and then hands the *path* to the loader, and a
  Windows byte-range lock belongs to the handle that took it, so opening the
  file a second time — from the same process — was refused and every create
  into a locked plan failed. The locks this process holds are registered now,
  and a read the lock refuses goes through the handle that holds it, by path
  first as before. §FS-rhei-new.4 **The supervisor's brief**: the sentence
  naming where a brief goes pasted `/<task-id>.md` onto a path spelled with
  `\`, so it read as two different directories. §FS-rhei-supervision.5.2
  **`install-skills --link`**: symlinks are the one thing this command cannot do
  on Windows; the refusal and its help are now what the spec says and what the
  test pins. §REQ-cross-platform.2 **The N-API cdylib**: its manifest says
  `test = false`, but `--all-targets` selects the lib target explicitly and
  overrides that, and the harness that resulted found no Node and aborted the
  whole job. **`cmd /c` was handed an escaped argument**: a command line is not
  an argument, and the escaping Rust applies to one turned every `\"` in a
  callback into a character the program then read as part of its code.
  **A canonicalized path leaked its `\\?\` prefix** into the run report, the
  log lines, and the working directory of every callback — where `cmd.exe`
  refuses to start, says so, and silently uses the Windows directory instead, so
  a relative command in a callback ran somewhere else entirely.
  §REQ-cross-platform.5 (PR #97)

  The test directories go with the tests now. Every end-to-end and integration
  test creates a directory of its own and removed it on its last line — a line
  that only runs when the test reaches it, so every failing test kept its tree
  and tens of gigabytes of `rhei-integ-*` accumulated in the system temp
  directory. An RAII guard removes it on the unwinding path too;
  `RHEI_KEEP_TEST_DIRS=1` keeps them for debugging. (PR #97)

- Windows CI now runs the test suite it can: every crate's unit tests,
  `rhei-core`'s integration tests, and the CLI's integration target, which
  spawns the built `rhei` and reads what it wrote. Together they cover the
  parsers, the validator, workspace and Panta loading, qualified ids, the
  transition ledger, every prompt renderer, and the commands that rewrite a
  plan — the path handling where Windows differs most. Until now the Windows
  job stopped after `cargo build`, so Windows proved compilation and nothing
  about behaviour. The CLI's e2e target, which drives `sh` mock agents
  throughout, is still Linux and macOS only, as are the individual integration
  tests that stand a shell script up as an agent, a polled program, or a
  callback. §AR-ci-release.1 (PR #94)

  Running them found four things that were broken on Windows and are now
  fixed. **Run liveness**: a lock somebody holds is refused with a different
  error per operating system, and rhei recognised only the Unix one, so every
  live Windows run read as *undecided* — `rhei runs` hedged about it,
  `rhei attach` and `rhei stop` hedged about reaching it, and a second
  `rhei run` on the same workspace neither queued nor refused.
  §FS-rhei-run-headless.3 **Rooted artifact paths**: a state declaring
  `path: /etc/passwd`, and a ticket linking its result to one, were rejected
  on Unix and accepted on Windows, where a path needs a drive letter to count
  as absolute; both are rejected everywhere now. §FS-rhei-states.1.3
  **Snapshot lineage**: where the platform has no unprivileged symlinks the
  `current` pointer is written as a one-line file, but only the symlink form
  was ever read back, so every cached snapshot looked stale and `inherit:`
  resolved nothing. §FS-rhei-snapshots.7 **Plan rewrites**: a file lock is
  advisory on Unix and mandatory on Windows, so `rhei complete`,
  `rhei transition`, `rhei reset`, `rhei new`, and a dashboard gate choice
  locked the plan and were then refused their own read of it — and then
  refused the rename over it. `rhei new` failed twice over: a project create
  read its own lock as another command rewriting the plan and gave up saying
  so, and a lone-plan create died on its own write. Getting the rename through
  on Windows means releasing that lock for the length of it, so a rewrite there
  has a window in which a waiting command can read the plan as it stood before
  the rename and overwrite the change; closing it needs a lock that does not
  live on the file being replaced, which is #95. (PR #94)

  And a fifth, found the moment Windows first ran a test that *spawns* `rhei`
  rather than calling into it: the CLI overflowed the main thread's stack on
  every invocation there, `rhei` with no arguments included. Windows reserves
  1 MiB for a main thread where Linux and macOS give 8, and clap's command tree
  and the plan parser's recursion both live on it. The CLI now runs on a thread
  whose stack it sizes itself, so the size travels with the binary instead of
  depending on how it was linked. §FS-rhei-distribution.1 (PR #94)

  And a sixth, one line further on: `rhei init` compared the directory it had
  written the agent-discovery note into against the host directory by spelling.
  Windows answers a canonicalized path in the `\\?\` verbatim form, so the two
  never matched, and init left `AGENTS.md` out of the files it says it changed
  while announcing it as a write to the repository root. Both comparisons ask
  whether it is the same directory now. §FS-rhei-init.5 (PR #94)

- CI now runs as two parallel jobs instead of one: `test` (fmt, clippy,
  build, test on three platforms) and `lint` (grund, fissile, lychee,
  attribution, changelog). The Ubuntu job used to carry every repository gate
  on top of the test run — compiling `lychee`, `fissile`, and `grund` from
  source on every run, then `pre-commit run --all-files`, which ran fmt,
  clippy, build, and the whole test suite a second time — and took ~9 minutes
  against ~3 for macOS, so every pull request and every release waited on it.
  The gate binaries are now cached by their pinned versions, and the cargo
  hooks are skipped in the lint job because the test job has just run them.
  §AR-ci-release.1 (PR #93)
