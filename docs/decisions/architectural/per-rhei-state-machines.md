# DA-per-rhei-state-machines: The state machine is a per-rhei property, defaulted by the manifest

## Status

accepted

## Context

Panta shipped with a deliberate limit: one state machine governed a whole
project. The `index.panta.md` declaration (or the built-in `rhei` machine) was
the law; a member rhei could restate it but declaring a different machine was a
load error, and per-rhei divergence was parked on the roadmap as polish.
§FS-rhei-panta.6 §AR-rhei-panta.4

Two later product moves invalidated the limit's weighting without revisiting
it. Templates became the front door — ten built-ins ship in the binary, each
necessarily bundling its own state machine, because each template *is* a
distinct process (a review loop is not a product-management loop). And
`rhei instantiate` learned to land templates in the enclosing project by
default, adopting the first template's machine as the project default so the
first instantiation would work at all. The combination armed a first-session
wall: template #1 succeeded frictionlessly and silently locked the project to
its machine; templates #2 through #10 were refused, with only a second-class
standalone workspace as the way out — while the README promised "automate your
complex daily routines in minutes", plural, in one repository. Adoption also
broke the other direction: once a template's machine became the project
default, a later hand-written rhei with no `**States:**` line validated
against the *template's* machine and failed.

The technical root was not the guard rails but the merge: member `Rhei`
structs dissolve into one flat, project-qualified task list, and while
per-*file* ownership survives (task sources and roots, for routing writes
back), per-*machine* ownership was checked at load and then discarded. With
ownership-of-meaning gone from the model, every downstream consumer had to
assume one machine. The redundant declaration was the tell: `**States:**`
existed at two levels with a rule that the lower must restate the upper — a
field whose only legal value is "same as the parent" is a field that wants to
be an override. The plan language even said so already:
§FS-rhei-plan-language.1.3 resolved the effective declaration "per rhei", with
"a declaration in the rhei itself wins" — the Panta layer clamped it back to
uniformity.

## Decision

The state machine is a property of the **rhei**, defaulted by the project.

1. `index.panta.md`'s `**States:**` declaration is the project **default** —
   the built-in `rhei` machine when absent. It governs every rhei that
   declares nothing, the synthetic `basin` rhei, and the Panta root's node
   policy.
2. A rhei that declares its own `**States:**` runs under the machine it
   names. Restating the default is legal and equivalent to omitting the line.
   Divergence is not an error; it is the normal shape of a project holding
   more than one instantiated template.
3. The merge **records** machine ownership instead of discarding it: the
   project model carries, per rhei, the declared machine name (when declared)
   and the rhei's execution root, and every consumer resolves a ticket's
   machine through its owning rhei.
4. The graph stays one merged, project-qualified task list (§DA-panta-root is
   unchanged). Machines are never combined, namespaced, or merged.
5. Cross-rhei readiness is the one computation where two machines meet: a
   `**Prior:**` is satisfied when the target ticket is
   terminal-and-not-cancelled **under the target's own machine**. Every other
   operation — state validity, transition legality, completion-target
   selection, artifact contracts, agent bindings — is a per-ticket question
   answered by the owning rhei's machine.
6. Machine files resolve per declaration: a self-declaring rhei's execution
   root `states.yaml` first (the shape every template ships), then the
   existing project-root / unique-name-match rules. §AR-rhei-panta.4
7. `--state-machine` stays a whole-scope override and errors when any
   in-scope rhei declares a name different from the override file's.
8. Machine **adoption** is removed everywhere it existed — `rhei instantiate`
   no longer writes a template's machine into `index.panta.md`, and
   `rhei init` no longer adopts a unanimously-declared machine — because
   adoption's only purpose was to satisfy the uniformity rule this decision
   removes, and its side effect was re-governing future silent rheis.

## Consequences

- Instantiating any number of templates into one project works; the
  machine-collision refusal and its standalone-workspace escape hatch are
  gone from that path.
- Projects that already adopted a machine keep loading: their members restate
  the default, which stays legal.
- Monitoring surfaces (`rhei states`, list/render/viz) present per-rhei
  machines grouped by rhei; state names are meaningful only relative to an
  owning rhei, and name collisions across machines are permitted.
- The validator, readiness, execution, and snapshot paths dispatch per ticket
  through the recorded ownership; the single-machine call surface survives
  only as a compatibility wrapper for single-rhei loads.
