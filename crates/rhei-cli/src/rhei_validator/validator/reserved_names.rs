// Its own part because a reserved name is a contract between the machine an

/// Whether a bare state name is the reserved cancellation state.
///
/// `cancelled` is reserved: a machine may name its abandon state whatever it
/// likes, but only this name — and `canceled`, accepted as the same name —
/// carries the engine's cancellation semantics. A cancelled prior does not
/// satisfy a dependency, `rhei complete` never selects it, the run report marks
/// it apart from success, and a transition into it waives the abandoned step's
/// declared outputs. One predicate so those four never disagree.
///
/// The argument is a *normalized* state name: strip any `-<n>` visit suffix
/// first (`normalized_state_name` in the CLI does that).
