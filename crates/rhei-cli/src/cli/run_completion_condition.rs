// The completion condition asked of one invocation at a time, and the two
// questions `rhei run` puts to it: *may this invocation be skipped* before a
// pass spawns it, and *has the state finished* once one has exited.
//
// Its own part because those two moments used to hold two different rules. The
// scheduler asked only whether the declared `outputs:` were on disk, so an
// invocation that had failed the condition on one pass — outputs written, the
// ticket's terminal result never written — was read on the next as having
// nothing left to do, and the ticket advanced into a `final: true` state on the
// strength of artifacts that had never answered for it. One rule, one place.

// §AR-source-file-size.3 §FS-rhei-agents.3.2 §FS-rhei-run.3

/// One state visit, ready to be asked the completion condition about each of
/// its invocations.
///
/// `artifact_root` is the owning rhei's execution root: where declared
/// `outputs:` resolve and where results live. One field, not two same-typed
/// roots, because both resolve against the same place and a run-level root
/// passed here would look in the wrong directory for a Panta project member.
/// §FS-rhei-agents.3.2 condition (2)
/// `finishes_ticket` is a property of the *edge* the exit would select, not of
/// the state, which is why it is settled once here rather than re-derived per
/// invocation.
