/// Held from before the first plan load through the write, both validation
/// passes, and any rollback. Anything narrower still loses tickets: the sibling
/// numbering is read from the same file the write then modifies, and a rollback
/// restores a snapshot taken before it. `Drop` releases it on every exit path,
/// and the OS releases it if the process dies — a lock nobody holds cannot go
/// stale, so there is nothing to reap.
///
/// The lock is the same [`LockedPlanFile`] every other rewriting command takes,
/// so a create reads and replaces the file it locked the way they do. That is
/// not a tidiness: on Windows the lock is a mandatory byte range, and a create
/// with a lock of its own devising is refused its own read and its own rename.
