// Supervised subprocess groups.
//
// Every subprocess `rhei run` starts to do a ticket's work — agents, programs,
// and the snapshot redactor — is a process group it owns, with exactly one
// early-termination path and three reasons to take it: the invocation's
// deadline, an operator interrupt, or the supervisor's death. Timeout and
// shutdown are two triggers of the same routine, applied to the group.
//
// Three subprocesses are deliberately outside this, each for its own reason:
// a subprocess a *callback* starts is that callback's own child and the
// callback contract governs it; the `git` queries of the post-transition
// consistency check are short synchronous bookkeeping that ends before the
// call returns; and the editor the dashboard launches is detached on purpose,
// because it belongs to the operator and outliving the run is the point.
