Usage: {usage}

Inspection:
  validate    Validate a markdown plan against the configured states
  render      Render a markdown plan into a selected output format
  states      Print the states and allowed transitions for the configured state machine
  list        List tasks in a plan with optional filters
  viz         Render a self-contained HTML flow visualization of a plan or workspace

Templates:
  templates   List available templates
  instantiate Instantiate a template into a concrete plan or workspace

Execution:
  transition  Atomically transition a task from one state to another (compare-and-swap)
  run         Execute a plan by advancing tasks through the state machine in dependency order
  attach      Connect a live surface to a run this shell did not start
  runs        List the runs that are live on this machine
  stop        Ask a run to stop, entering the same interruption path as Ctrl+C
  intervene   Send a message to a running agent's stdin during a live run
  cost        Inspect run token and cost accounting artifacts
  snapshot    Inspect, prune, or continue from session snapshots
  next        Transition the next ready task to the next state
  complete    Complete a task: transition to terminal state, write ledger/result,\n              link it from the task, and remove the assignee
  release     Drop a ticket's assignee so abandoned work can be claimed again
  reset       Reset all tasks and subtasks to the initial state; for workspaces,\n              also remove runtime output

Authoring:
  new         Create a rhei under Panta, or a ticket inside one with --under

Setup:
  init            Set up a Panta project in a gitignored `panta/` folder (or in place with --here)
  install-skills  Install rhei skills into AI coding agent configuration directories
  completions     Generate shell completion scripts

Info:
  version     Print versions for the CLI and related crates
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
