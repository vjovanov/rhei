description: Execute tasks in a Rhei Plan markdown document without an orchestrator. Takes one required argument `<plan>` — the path to a `.rhei.md` file or a Directory Workspace `index.rhei.md` (e.g. `rhei-plan-worker docs/my-plan.rhei.md`). Use when the user asks to work, implement, advance, drive, or make progress on a specific `.rhei.md` plan — the worker self-selects the next eligible task, works in its current state, logs subtask progress, advances state, finalizes with a result, and respects human-review gates.

# Rhei Plan Worker (Unorchestrated)

Pick up a Rhei Plan and make progress on it without any external scheduler. The worker is driven by the plan itself: the state machine defines what is legal, `**Prior:**` edges define what is ready, and each state's `instructions` field defines what to do.

Do not repurpose this skill for plan authoring — use `rhei-plan-writer` for that. Structural edits to the plan are limited to logging subtask progress and updating child task states; all root-task state changes and assignments go through the CLI.

## Parameters

The skill takes a single required parameter:

- `<plan>` — path to the `.rhei.md` file for a Single-File Plan, or the `index.rhei.md` at the root of a Directory Workspace.

Invoke as `rhei-plan-worker <plan>` (e.g., `rhei-plan-worker examples/ci-heal/index.rhei.md`). If the caller does not supply `<plan>`, ask for it and stop — do not guess, scan the working directory, or pick from multiple candidates. The plan path is the worker's only source of truth for which plan to drive; all other inputs (state machine, task selection, transitions) are derived from the plan file and the state machine it declares.

## Operating Loop

Execute this loop until no eligible task remains or a human gate stops you:

1. **Validate the plan.** Run `rhei validate <plan>`. If it fails, stop and report — do not work a broken plan, and never skip validation.
2. **Load the state machine.** Run `rhei states` against the plan (or `rhei states --state-machine <path>`) to read allowed states, their `instructions`, and the transition graph. The CLI resolves the machine from the plan's `**States:**` field (or a sibling/workspace `states.yaml`); add `--json` for structured data. Fall back to reading the YAML directly, or [default-states.md](../rhei-plan-writer/references/default-states.md), if the CLI is unavailable.
3. **Read the plan.** Prefer `rhei render <plan> --format json --pretty` for structured access. Read the raw markdown too — you will edit it in place to log subtask progress.
4. **Claim the next task.** Run `rhei next <plan>`. It atomically selects the next claimable task (see *Task Selection*), writes `**Assignee:**` on it, and prints the task id, current state, and resolved instructions. If nothing is claimable, stop — the plan is done or blocked.
    - Use `rhei next <plan> --peek` first for a read-only look at what would be claimed.
    - If `rhei next` fails with a missing-artifact error, the current state requires an input file that does not exist — surface it; do not skip ahead.
5. **Work in the current state.** Follow the printed instructions verbatim. The state you are handed is where the work happens — `rhei next` does **not** advance state. Implement child task nodes in order, logging per child (see *Progress Logging*). If the ticket you were handed is itself a parent, its subtree is already terminal — the work is the parent's own (see *Parent tasks*).
6. **Advance state only when the workflow demands it.** Use `rhei transition` for intermediate hops; for terminal completion use `rhei complete` (see *State Transitions*).
7. **Finalize with `rhei complete`.** Run `rhei complete <plan> --task <id> --result "<one-line summary>"`. It transitions to the first reachable non-cancelled terminal, appends a `## Result` entry with the message to `runtime/results/<task-id>.md`, links that file via `> **Result:**`, and removes `**Assignee:**`. `<task-id>` is the project-qualified id (`plan.1` for `plan.rhei.md`); `rhei next` prints qualified ids, and `--task` accepts both the qualified id and the rhei-local shorthand. The message is not paperwork: no task enters a `final: true` state without one, so write the sentence a reader six months from now needs.
8. **Stop at terminal or gating states.** `completed` is final in the built-in machine. Any state with `gating: true` in a custom machine halts the worker — do not transition out of it autonomously, and do not try to `rhei complete` through it.
9. **Loop.** Return to step 4. Re-read the plan on every pass; the markdown file is the single source of truth.

## Task Selection

Selection is owned by `rhei next` — do not re-implement it in prose. A task is claimable when:

1. Every descendant task node it has is in a terminal state. A leaf satisfies this trivially.
2. Every task in its `**Prior:**` list is in a terminal state (`final: true`; `completed` in the default machine).
3. The task has no `**Assignee:**` field.
4. The current state is neither terminal nor gating.
5. Every required `inputs` artifact declared on the current state exists.

When multiple tasks are claimable, `rhei next` picks the first in plan order — do not pre-rank by descendant count or other heuristics. Validation rejects plans where a child task lists its parent or another ancestor as `**Prior:**`; if you hit that failure, do not work around it by manually claiming the child — ask for or make a structural fix so the follow-up task is a sibling.

### Parent tasks

A task with child nodes is a task in its own right, not a container that fills up. Nothing advances it when its children advance: it carries its own state, its own work, and its own result. Rule 1 is the only thing that makes it different — it is not claimable while any descendant is still open, and it becomes claimable the moment the last one closes.

So a parent is worked exactly like a leaf, just later: `rhei next` hands it to you after its subtree is terminal — unless its state declares `execute_on:`, in which case it is handed to you *between* its children instead (see *Supervising parents*). You do whatever its state's instructions say (the integration, the verification, the write-up the children do not cover), and you finish it with `rhei complete`. Do not try to skip it, and do not read a parent left in `pending` after its children finished as a bug — it is work waiting for you.

Two refusals follow from the same rule, and neither is worked around by editing markdown:

- `rhei next --task <parent>` while a descendant is open fails, naming the open descendants and the ticket that is claimable instead. Claim that one.
- Any move into a terminal state — `rhei complete`, `rhei transition`, an orchestrated run — is refused on a task with a non-terminal descendant. Finish or cancel the descendants first; `cancelled` is terminal, so a deliberately abandoned child releases its parent.

### Supervising parents

A parent whose current state declares `execute_on:` is a **supervisor**: `rhei next` hands it to you *while* its subtree is open, at every checkpoint, not once at the end. Which moves reach you is that state's `execute_on` value — every finished child, every child transition, every finished descendant, or every descendant transition — and your prompt says which. The visit is short and it is not the parent's own work:

1. **Judge the checkpoints.** `rhei next` prints `## Checkpoints` — the descendants that moved since the last visit, each with what that step left behind — plus `## Supervising This Subtree`, which gives the paths below.
2. **Steer the next step.** Write a brief at `<root>/runtime/supervise/<task-id>.md` (read by every state of that descendant) or `<root>/runtime/supervise/<task-id>/<state>.md` (that state only). Append a child by editing the parent's own task file. Cancel a step the checkpoints made unnecessary with `rhei transition <plan> --task <child> --from <state> --to cancelled --result "<why>"` — a cancel does not have to satisfy the cancelled step's declared outputs, but it does have to say why.
3. **End the visit.** Run `rhei transition <plan> --task <P> --from <s> --to <s>` — the state's own self-loop. That one edge is the release: it lets the subtree run again and drops your `**Assignee:**`, so the next checkpoint is claimed afresh. Do not leave the visit by editing markdown, and do not hold the ticket across checkpoints.
4. **Finish it** with `rhei complete` only once every descendant is terminal; the machine's `openDescendants < 1` edge is what selects that.

While you hold a supervisor's visit, nothing beneath it runs. A `rhei next --task <child>` refusal that says the child is *held by supervisor Task \<P\>* is not your ticket to force — it names the supervisor to work instead, or the worker holding it and the `rhei release` that hands it back.

A resumable task (already carrying your own `**Assignee:**` from an interrupted prior session) is not re-claimable via `rhei next`. Resume it directly: read the current state, follow its instructions, and advance with `rhei transition` / `rhei complete` as usual.

## State Transitions

All root-task state transitions go through the CLI. Never edit a root `**State:**` line by hand.

```bash
rhei transition <plan> --task <id> --from <current-state> --to <target-state>
```

The CLI provides file locking; compare-and-swap (`--from` guards against racing workers — if another agent already transitioned the task, the command fails and prints the actual state); transition validation (illegal edges rejected before any write); artifact enforcement (required `outputs:` on the source state must exist); callbacks (`on_leave` / `on_enter` fire unless `--no-callbacks`); and the central ledger entry in `runtime/state-transitions.log`. On conflict, re-read the plan and re-claim with `rhei next` — do not retry the same transition blindly.

`rhei complete` stays the everyday finishing verb: it picks the first reachable non-cancelled terminal for you, so you do not have to name the state. Reach for `rhei transition --result` when you mean a *specific* terminal state `complete` will not choose — cancelling a ticket, or routing to a `failed`/`rejected` state:

```bash
rhei transition <plan> --task <id> --from <current-state> --to cancelled \
  --result "Abandoned: superseded by Task 7."
```

Either way the message is required. No task enters a `final: true` state without a non-empty `runtime/results/<task-id>.md` — the ticket's own record of why it ended there — so a bare `rhei transition` into a terminal state is refused, naming the file and the flag. `rhei transition` is not a way around a refusal either: it skips `**Prior:**` readiness as a deliberate escape hatch, but the descendants-first rule and the result rule are enforced on the same shared path for every verb, so it refuses a parent with an open descendant exactly as `rhei complete` does.

### Typical transitions for the default `rhei` machine

- `pending` → `completed` — the task is done.

If the loaded machine differs from the default, trust it over this list.

## Assignee Discipline

`**Assignee:**` is owned by the CLI — never edit it by hand. `rhei next` writes it when claiming; any move into a terminal state removes it, whether that move came from `rhei complete` or `rhei transition`; a supervising state's self-loop removes it too, because that edge ends the visit it was claimed for (see *Supervising parents*); every other non-terminal `rhei transition` leaves it untouched, so a long-running task keeps the same assignee across intermediate transitions in custom machines.

## Progress Logging

Log implementation progress by appending to each task node's body — do not invent new metadata fields.

- One short paragraph per leaf task node, written as you complete it (not batched at the end).
- State the concrete change: files touched, functions added, commands run to verify. Do not restate the task title; extend the description.
- When a task re-enters an earlier state in a custom machine, append a new paragraph describing the rework rather than rewriting history. If the machine uses counted visits, the re-rendered `**State:** <name>-<n>` line makes the visit explicit — do not edit that suffix by hand.

## Agent Review

When a task enters `agent-review`, the reviewer is a *different* mental mode, not a different person. The reviewer reads the task description, its child task nodes, and the diff actually produced; checks repository conventions (lint, format, test commands listed in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) or the project's equivalent); records concrete findings as a new paragraph in the task body prefixed with `Review:` (one bullet per finding); and chooses the next edge — `agent-review-fix` (rework), `human-review` (needs human), or straight to terminal via `rhei complete` (pass). Never finalize a task whose tests or build fail.

## Editing Discipline

State transitions and progress logging are separate concerns:

- **Root task `**State:**`, `**Assignee:**`, and `> **Result:**`** are CLI-owned — see *State Transitions* and *Assignee Discipline*. Never edit them by hand.
- **Child task state transitions** — child nodes carry their own mandatory `**State:**` field. For child-only flows in the default machine you may update child states directly in the markdown as you finish each one. If the active machine's `node_policy` routes children through a stateful profile that uses the CLI, prefer `rhei transition` / `rhei complete` for children too.
- **Progress logging** — edit the markdown directly to append per-child progress.

- **New tickets** are `rhei new`, never a hand-written task block — see *Capturing Work You Did Not Come For*.

Run `rhei validate <plan>` after any direct edit; a failure means the edit is wrong — fix it before moving on. Preserve IDs, titles, `**Prior:**` edges, and frontmatter (structural changes belong to the plan writer). Do not reorder tasks, delete completed or cancelled tasks, remove `> **Result:**` links, or reformat unrelated sections.

## Capturing Work You Did Not Come For

Implementing a ticket turns up work that is not this ticket's: a bug next door, a follow-up, a cleanup the diff made obvious. Do not widen the ticket, and do not hand-write a task block into the plan — capture it and carry on:

```bash
rhei new "Null-cache panic in the avatar loader" --under basin \
  --description "Seen while working plan.3; reproduces on an empty cache."
```

`--under basin` is the project's unfiled inbox: it takes a ticket that has no rhei chosen yet, creates the basin on demand, and files nothing into your plan. When the work clearly belongs to a rhei that exists, name it instead (`--under auth`), and add `--prior <id>` when it genuinely cannot start before something else. `rhei new` allocates the id under a lock, validates the result, and rolls the write back if it broke anything, so capturing is safe mid-task.

Capture is the only creation a worker does. Creating a *rhei*, and running an orchestrator, are the human's call. This is also not a way to move work off the ticket you were handed: capture what is genuinely out of scope, and finish what you claimed.

## Stopping Conditions

Stop the loop and report when any of these is true:

- `rhei next` prints no claimable task (everything terminal, blocked on a gating state in a custom machine, or awaiting priors).
- A task reaches a gating state in a custom machine — stop *that* task but keep working independent branches of the DAG by re-running `rhei next`.
- `rhei validate` fails after an edit you cannot explain.
- A CAS conflict on `rhei transition` / `rhei complete` cannot be resolved by re-claiming (another worker is actively driving the same plan and there is no other eligible work).
- The task requires information or access the worker does not have (credentials, external decisions, missing input artifact) — stop and ask.

When stopping, print a short summary: which tasks advanced, which task is blocked and why, and what the next human action is.

## Unorchestrated Mode Notes

"Unorchestrated" means **no** external process tells the worker what to do next. Consequences:

- The worker reads the plan on every pass; treat the markdown file(s) as the single source of truth and do not cache state across passes beyond the current conversation.
- Multiple workers can safely operate on the same plan: `rhei next` acquires a file lock and `rhei transition` / `rhei complete` use compare-and-swap — the loser of a race re-reads and re-claims. Do not batch multiple task transitions into one command — one task, one transition, then re-read.
- Directory Workspaces behave the same, except the lock scope is per-task-file rather than per-plan — which is why the format exists.

This worker flow is distinct from `rhei run` (agent mode): under `rhei run`, the orchestrator spawns a subprocess for each claimed state and performs the transition after the subprocess exits; the worker skill does the work manually instead.

## Missing Information Handling

If the plan path, state machine, or a task description is ambiguous or missing required detail:

- Ask the user before editing, and never invent prerequisites, states, or transitions to unblock selection.
- If a task description is too thin to implement, surface it and ask for clarification — do not silently expand scope.
